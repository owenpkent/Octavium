[DEMO - Quick montage of Octavium in action]

[TALKING HEAD]

What if you could make music... with just a mouse?

No keyboard. No fancy MIDI controller. Just... click.

Hey, I'm Owen, and I built Octavium — an open-source virtual MIDI keyboard designed from the ground up for accessibility.

Today I want to show you what it does, why I made it, and how you can start using it — or even help build it.


[TALKING HEAD]

So here's the thing.

Most music software assumes you have two hands... that can move independently... across a physical keyboard.

But that's not everyone.

Maybe you have a motor disability. Maybe you're recovering from an injury. Maybe you just don't own a MIDI controller and want to sketch out ideas with your mouse.

Traditional virtual keyboards? They're an afterthought. Tiny keys, no sustain, no way to build chords comfortably.

I wanted something better.

[B-ROLL if available]

And here's what I realized: when you design for accessibility first... you end up making something better for everyone.

That's called universal design.

Curb cuts were designed for wheelchairs — but they help everyone. Parents with strollers. Delivery workers with carts. Skateboarders.

Octavium is my curb cut for music software.


[DEMO - Launch Octavium]

Let me show you how it works.

When you launch Octavium, you get this launcher window. Pick a keyboard size — or open multiple windows at once. They all share the same MIDI output, so no port conflicts.

[DEMO - 49-key piano]

Here's the 49-key piano. Click a key... it plays. Simple.

But watch this — I can click and drag across the keys for a glissando.

That's something you can't easily do on a real keyboard unless you've practiced it.

[DEMO - Sustain]

Now, sustain. Turn it on... and notes ring out after I release the mouse.

But here's the key insight: the visual clears immediately. So I always know what I just touched, even while the sound continues.

[DEMO - Latch]

And then there's latch. This is where it gets powerful.

With latch on, I click a note — it stays on. Click again — it turns off.

So I can build a chord... one note at a time... with a single mouse.

That's accessibility.


[DEMO - Harmonic Table]

But we're just getting started.

This is the Harmonic Table — an isomorphic layout where horizontal movement is perfect fifths, and diagonals are thirds.

It makes harmonic relationships visual. You can literally see how notes relate to each other.

[DEMO - Quick tour]

There's also a Chord Monitor for saving and playing chord cards... a 4x4 pad grid for drums... CC faders... and an XY pad for expressive control.

All mouse-driven. All accessible.


[TALKING HEAD]

Now... what if the software could play itself?

[DEMO - Modulune]

Meet Modulune — Octavium's generative counterpart.

It creates continuously evolving piano textures in real time. Impressionistic, flowing, never exactly the same twice.

I can adjust tempo... change the key... switch textures...

And it just plays.

It's like having a collaborator who never gets tired.


[TALKING HEAD]

Alright, let's talk tech for a second.

Octavium is built with Python, PySide6 for the UI, and mido for MIDI output. It falls back to pygame if you don't have rtmidi installed.

[DEMO - Code scroll]

The codebase is clean, well-commented, and very hackable.

[TALKING HEAD]

And it's completely open source — MIT licensed. Use it however you want.


[TALKING HEAD]

So here's my ask.

If you think accessible music tools matter... star the repo. It helps more people find it.

If you want to try it... clone it, pip install, and you're making music in under a minute.

And if you're a developer... I want your pull requests.

Add new keyboard layouts. Improve the UI. Port it to other platforms. Make it yours.

[DEMO - GitHub repo]

Link's in the description. The README has everything you need to get started.

[TALKING HEAD]

Music should be for everyone. Let's build that future together.

I'm Owen. Thanks for watching.

And hey — happy music making.
